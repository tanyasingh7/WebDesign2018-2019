    Hello again!
  </p>

  <p>
  Here is more about me! :)
  </p>
  <img src="img/swim.png" width="200" height="320" alt="">
    <p>
      I have been a swimmer my whole life! I did synchronized swimming for 6 years, competitive swimming for 4 years, and I teach swim lessons and lifeguard!
      In 2016, I traveled to Greensboro, NC to participate in the Junior Olympics for synchronized swimming. I also used to competitive swim for my highschool, Worcester Academy. Qualifying for championships, my main events were fly and backstroke.

  <p>
  In addition to swimming, I am also very passionate about filmmaking. I co-founded Film Neev, an organization intended to educate individuals about the religion of Sikhism as well as teach the art of filmmaking. We use filmmaking as a medium to spread awareness about Sikhism as well as shine light on the discrimination and hate crimes Sikhs face on a regular basis.

  This is my little brother! He's one of my bestfriends and I love him so much (& cheeto puffs as pictured). Fun Fact : We have the same birthday - we are exactly 8 years apart
