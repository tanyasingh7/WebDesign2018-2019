<p>
  After 9/11, Sikh men and women wearing turbans have been singled out and targeted as terrorists.
  According to a national survey, six out of ten Sikh children are bullied in schools; Sikhs face
  high levels of employment discrimination with dozens of cases pending in courts; and Sikhs are
  always singled out for secondary screenings at airports despite clear directives that profiling
  is illegal. Most of this prejudice stems from the judgement and misconceptions of turbans and
  turban wearing Sikh's themselves. Due to the lack of awareness about the religion itself, many
  individuals correlater the sight of a turban to that of a terrorist.
