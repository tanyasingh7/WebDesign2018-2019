       <p class='question'> When is she? </p>
       <p class='pic'><img src="img/when.jpg" width="200" height="400" alt=""></p>
       <p class='par'> ...doing what? Honestly probaly never. As I said, a very lazy girl.
         But if she likes it or is excited for it she'll get it done as soon as possible.
         If it's homework, she'll wait for the last minute, but always get it done in the best way
         possible, meaning she WILL stay up all night and not sleep for 72 hours - it has happened
         way too many times this semester. She is coming home to Boston soon!! </p>

       <p class='question'> Where is she? </p>
       <p class='pic'><img src="img/where.jpg" width="200" height="400" alt=""></p>
       <p class='par'> She is in New York!! Finally. After years and years of dreaming to live in NYC,
         she is finally there. Thank god, she was so annoying about it. She loves it. Sometimes she goes
         back to Boston, sometimes meaning A LOT. She has bad FOMO so whenever something happens that looks
         even a teensy tiny bit of fun, you can get bet your bottom she is already at Port Authority sprinting
         so she doesn't miss her bus. Most of the time, however, she is in bed. For someone who rarely sleeps,
         she spends way too much time in her bed. </p>

       <p class='question'> Why is she? </p>
      <p class='pic'> <img src="img/why.jpg" width="200" height="400" alt=""></p>
      <p class='par'> ...so annoying?  So stupid?  We honestly do not know. We've been trying to
        figure it out for a while now. Please check back later for an updated answer (hopefully). </p>
